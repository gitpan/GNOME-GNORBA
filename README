GNOME::GNORBA 0.0.2
===================

The GNOME::GNORBA module sets up cookies appropriately for
using ORBit in a GNOME environment, and also provides
an interface to GOAD. (The GNOME Object Activation Directory)


Install
=======

You must have the CORBA::ORBit module installed first.
It is available from the place you got this module.

Once you have the the ORBit module installed, do:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make

The package then can be installed by executing the command:

  make install


Trying it out
=============

With a recent version of gmc installed, do:

 perl -Mblib gmc-test

It should briefly pop up a file manager window
with a few files inside it, then close it again.

There is a gnumeric-test that can be used similarly.
